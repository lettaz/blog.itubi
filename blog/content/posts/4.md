In our journey to revolutionize the B2B trading platform landscape, Itubi has always been at the forefront of exploring innovative solutions to complex problems. Our recent involvement in supervising and guiding a comprehensive bachelor's thesis titled "Bridging the Gap: Comparing Text Retrieval Systems for B2B Trading" exemplifies our commitment to scientific inquiry and practical application. This thesis not only underscores the challenges faced by current B2B platforms but also highlights Itubi's pioneering approach to addressing these issues through cutting-edge research.


**The Challenge at Hand**

Our investigation into the realm of B2B trading revealed a glaring deficiency in the capacity of existing platforms to accommodate natural language queries effectively and to offer robust support post-matchmaking. This gap not only hinders the seamless identification of potential business partners but also complicates the journey towards successful trading partnerships. Itubi's inception was motivated by these challenges, with a vision to pioneer a platform that elevates the standards of international business collaboration through technological innovation.

**A Deep Dive into Research**

The thesis embarked on a mission to critically evaluate three advanced information retrieval systems: PostgreSQL Full Text Search, Semantic Search with pgvector, and Elasticsearch. Utilizing a dataset synthetically generated by GPT-4 allowed for a nuanced comparison of these systems, shedding light on their respective strengths and areas for improvement in the context of B2B trading.

**Key Insights and Discoveries**

One of the most enlightening outcomes of this research was the realization of the immense potential harbored by semantic search technologies. Despite Elasticsearch's robustness and alignment with industry standards, it was the prospect of harnessing semantic search's ability to comprehend the intricate nuances of queries that captivated our imagination. This approach promises a future where search functionalities transcend mere keyword matching, offering a more intuitive and context-aware mechanism to connect businesses.

**Methodological Approach**

The thesis was methodically structured to encompass a wide array of evaluative criteria, including search accuracy, latency, and the relevance of results. A notable innovation was the development of a unique dataset through GPT-4, tailored to reflect the complex nature of B2B interactions. This dataset became the foundation for rigorous testing, enabling a detailed assessment of each information retrieval system's performance.

**Performance Evaluation**

The evaluation process was meticulous, involving both automated and human-centric methodologies to gauge the efficacy of each search system. Through this dual-pronged approach, we were able to derive comprehensive insights into the operational dynamics of PostgreSQL Full Text Search, Semantic Search with pgvector, and Elasticsearch. Each system was critically analyzed for its response times, accuracy in query-result matching, and the overall relevance of the generated outcomes.

**Future Directions**

The thesis not only provided us with a wealth of valuable insights but also charted a course for future enhancements to our platform. The findings have laid a solid foundation for Itubi to innovate upon, with a clear roadmap toward integrating more sophisticated search technologies. Our commitment to this research-driven approach signifies our dedication to continuously exploring and solving complex problems that impact the efficiency of B2B trading.

**Conclusion: A Vision for the Future**

The collaboration on this thesis represents a significant milestone in Itubi's journey, marrying scientific rigor with the practical imperatives of the B2B trading sector. It reflects our unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible, driven by a deep understanding of the challenges at hand and the potential solutions within our reach. As we move forward, Itubi stands at the forefront of redefining the B2B trading experience, armed with insights and innovations that promise to transform the way businesses connect, collaborate, and succeed in the global marketplace.
